## Project Overview:

The purpose of this project is to analyse data from free vehicle advertisements that are published on the Crankshaft website. To do this it will be analysed the variables in this database and then perform data preprocessing to make the data as complete as possible without significantly changing the data values. Once this is done, it will be used graphical methods such as histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots to verify which variables can explain a high or low price.

## Impact:
Every day, hundreds of vehicle advertisements are posted on the Crankshaft List website, offering a rich source of data for understanding what drives vehicle prices. This project aims to analyse the data collected from these advertisements over the past few years to identify the key factors influencing a vehicle’s selling price. Using graphical techniques—including histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots—we were explored the relationships between these variables and vehicle prices, revealing which attributes are most strongly linked to high or low selling prices.

This analysis involved systematically cleaning and validating the car advertisement dataset, addressing anomalies and missing values, and exploring outliers to ensure accurate representation of the data. The study revealed key insights into vehicle listings and price determinants, confirming that vehicle age and mileage are inversely related to price, while good condition, specific colours (white, yellow, silver), and automatic transmissions command higher average prices. Additionally, SUVs and trucks dominated listings, whereas bus and truck models commanded the highest average prices. These findings provide a clear foundation for data-driven decision-making in the vehicle sales market.
